TO DOS:
1. Popup window for turning GPS on
2. If user doesn't turn GPS on, then quit?
3. If GPS not returning a location (e.g. indoors), then? In this case, it just ignores all this data.
4. So far, only checking if Wifi is *connected*. Should check if any open Wifi is available?
5. If there is movement in 60 seconds, but no movement in 5-second span, we can't detect direction. Currently, it uses the lat/long from the previous 60 second span (less accurate since more motion in 60 seconds than 5). Is this okay, or should we just discard that data?
6. What if we go out of range of GPS and then get WiFi (e.g. enter a building and then get WiFi). In this case, we wouldn't get any location updates, and will not be capture the fact that WiFi was found.
7. Corner cases when adding new points. How to add first point?
8. Replacement policy for the buffer of data points to send?
