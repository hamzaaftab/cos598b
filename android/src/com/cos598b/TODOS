TO DOS:
- Popup window for turning GPS on
- If user doesn't turn GPS on, then quit?
- What if we go out of range of GPS and then get WiFi (e.g. enter a building and then get WiFi). In this case, we wouldn't get any location updates, and will not be capture the fact that WiFi was found.
- Corner cases when adding new points. How to add first point?
- Check wifi power level as well to see if it is too low
