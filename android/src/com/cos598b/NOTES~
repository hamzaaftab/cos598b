Advantages of using Listeners
1. If no movement, then don't cause updates (e.g. sitting in office)
2. If no GPS, then no updates (e.g. underground, inside) - hence, forces us to only consider locations where the 3G vs. WiFi is useful (i.e. outside, walking in between buildings etc.)
		 
Assumption: If there is movement in the 60 second span, it will trigger updates in both listenersindependently of whether there was movement in the 5 second span. NEED TO TEST THIS 

What if person hasn't moved or was inside a building for a long time (i.e. no location updates for a long time), and then starts moving, then how accurate is the system?
Say the person was in a large building and the last location update was when the person was entering building through entry A, at location x. We have two scenarious:
1. Say, now they are exiting through exit A. 
a) If the location update is gotten at a point beyond x, then we get the correct direction estimate, i.e. we know that the person is moving away from the building. 
b) If on the other hand, we get the location update before x, it would make it seem that the person is moving towards the building, which is incorrect. In this case, however, we should have previously detected that at point x, you get WiFi very soon, if you're moving towards the building. So we would set a low threshold to delay the email, and the error will be corrected quite quickly.
2. Say they are exiting through entry B. Then a
